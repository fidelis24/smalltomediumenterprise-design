# üñß smalltomediumenterprise-design üñß

üñß Designed this topology using the software called Packet Tracer, version 7.2.1.0218. The design made is good for small to medium enterprise with the use of EIGRP routing protocol, dhcp server, subnetting, intervlan routing, etherchannel, pvst and additional base wifi configuration(WLC and Lightweight Access points). Made this topology as part of my preparation for CCNA certification.
